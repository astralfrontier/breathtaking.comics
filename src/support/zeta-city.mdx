# Zeta City

Twenty years ago, an alien species code-named "the Zeta" invaded Earth.
During the invasion, their mothership crash-landed on Earth.
The first investigators sent to understand and catalog its technology needed support - places to live, food to eat, and so on.
In a short amount of time, a city was forming.

Not all of Zeta City has been mapped, or is safe, even today. Science Pirates raid the mysterious off-limits "sector zero" for Zeta tech.
Heroes and villains battle for supremacy in the sky. Citizens benefit from a high-tech lifestyle, as long as they accept the risk of living in a hollowed-out alien UFO.

Zeta City is for...

- Traditional superhero-supervillain action
- Exciting adventure in a technologically advanced metropolis
- Stories about life in a dangerous place, interactions between heroes and civilians, and the influence of corpororations
