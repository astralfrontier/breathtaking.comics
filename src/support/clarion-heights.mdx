# Clarion Heights Academy and Miller Mountain Corrections

A grant from a wealthy benefactor established two schools, right next to each other.
One was to be a training ground for young people with powers, where they'd learn everything a responsible hero ought to know.
The other was a reform school and penitentiary for juvenile delinquents whose powers made reform a challenge.
By positioning the schools together, and encouraging interactions between the student bodies, the founder hoped that each group of kids would develop some empathy for the other.

Not everyone at hero school is good, and not everyone in corrections is bad.
Rivalries, teen crushes, and misunderstandings are all to be expected, both within each school's students and between the two.
Will this experiment yield a better future, or will it just reinforce the hero-villain divide?

CHA and MMC are for...

- Exciting and awkward interactions between teenage characters
- The combination of exciting powers and mundane school life
- Stories about coming of age, understanding emotions and the self, and authority vs. individuality
